	<h1>ADMIN PLACEHOLDER</h1>
	<p>
		There should be functions here which allow for easy modification to the database. For example, the admin could decide to delete or ban a user.
        CRUD - Create, read, update, delete. All such functions should be available to the admin here. They could read the list of users and passwords (non-encrypted for this project, not when in production) for instance.

    <p>
        A function to obtain a json file of data should also be created here.
