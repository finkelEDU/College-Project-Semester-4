# Website Project Semester 4
 A large project done in college between 3 modules.
 By Fintan Kelly (B00099936) and Oscar Neiland (B00164340).

# Contribution Statement
- We used a college pc together at the start for a lot of the initial code, including classes and backend functions, as Oscar's laptop was being weird with Github desktop.
- Oscar did most of the CSS functions, styling and frontend.
- Fintan added all CRUD functions to the admin.php page and adminController.php.
- We both discussed and planned our MVC together, then Oscar updated most code to have the MVC pattern.
- Fintan created the database and tables.
- Oscar updated code to be more efficient.

We feel that we both contributed equally to the project overall (50% each).
